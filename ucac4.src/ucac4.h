/* Changes from UCAC-3:  ra_sigma, dec_sigma, mag_sigma, pm_ra_sigma &
pm_dec_sigma were int16_ts in UCAC3. pm_ra & pm_dec were int32_ts.
n_cats_total has been removed for UCAC4,  as has SuperCOSMOS data.
APASS mags were added. The two Yale flags were combined,  to save a
byte.  The ra/dec and proper motion sigmas are now offset by 128;
i.e.,  a value of -128 would indicate a zero sigma.
