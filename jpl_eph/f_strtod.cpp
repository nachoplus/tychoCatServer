/* A few 'gotchas' that are now handled (or not) in this code :

   -- A string such as 3.141592e-4945 is well within the range of an
80-bit long double.  However,  it'll get read in as 3141592 multiplied
by 10^-4951,  and that last is outside the range of long doubles.
Which is why there's a bit of code starting with 'if( exponent >=
OVER_THE_TOP_EXPONENT)'. That will make the values to be multiplied
3.141592e-4090 and 10^-855, both within the range of long doubles.

   -- Microsoft doesn't "get" 80-bit doubles;  to them,  long doubles
and doubles are the same thing.  (Insert anti-MS rant here;  I doubt
I can use any profanity for them that hasn't already been done elsewhere.)
When compiled on an MS compiler,  LDBL_MAX_10_EXP will be 308;  on
everything else I've seen,  it'll be 4932.  Suitable #ifs and #ifdefs
have been added to handle this... at least for those two cases,  which
are the only two I can test.  It does lay the groundwork for machines
with 128-bit floats or those limited to 32-bit floats.

   -- In assembling the digits into an integer value,  we can handle
integers up to INT64_MAX / 10 - 1 without overflowing.  Beyond that,
we start putting the digits into 'part_two',  and keep track of how
many digits are so stored.  (We have to do that because an 80-bit long
double has 64 bits of mantissa,  and 'max_rval' only gives us about 61
bits.  But between 'rval' and 'part_two',  we actually have enough bits
to handle a 128-bit quadruple-precision float,  if that ever proves
desirable.)

   Anyway.  If 'rval' and 'part_two' both run out of digits (become
greater than 'max_rval'),  we'll have some digits that are just plain
skipped over (won't contribute to the value of a mere 80-bit float),
but we still have to keep track of them.

   NOTE that this implements the C90 (C++98) concept of strtod.  For
C99/C11/C++11,  we'd need to also handle hexadecimal floats,  INF,
INFINITY,  and the various flavors of NANs.  'errno' isn't set to
ERANGE,  and underflow may not be handled correctly.  I've not felt
the need to fix these yet.

   -- Comparison to the glib strtold() function (see 'ftest.cpp')
shows that roundoff can leave us one off in the last binary digit. (So
far,  I've not seen errors greater than one digit.)  Fixing this would
be _very_ challenging.  In "borderline" cases,  one may have to read
over 700 decimal digits before being able to decide which way roundoff
should go in the binary conversion.  I think fast_strtod is correct
(to the last bit) for almost all "real-world" input.  (The failures
occur when there are more than about 17 digits,  and in some cases
involving high exponents.)  I'd like to define that a little better;
ideally,  we might be able to have the function realize when it might
fail,  then turn those very unusual cases over to "standard" strtold.

   I think this code gets a truly correct result in all cases :
