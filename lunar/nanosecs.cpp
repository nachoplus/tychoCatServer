/* 'nanoseconds_since_1970( )' returns something close to the result of
ctime( ),  except a billion times larger and with added precision.
Naturally,  DOS/Windows,  OS/X,  and POSIX systems each use different
methods.

   As currently coded,  the actual precision provided is 10^-7 second
in Windows;  a millisecond with the WATCOM compiler;  and 10^-6 second
in everything else.  But note that "true" nanosecond precision is
possible,  if actually desired (see the NOT_CURRENTLY_IN_USE code).

   The range of a 64-bit signed integer is large enough to enable
this function to work until Friday, 2262 Apr 11 23:47:16.854775808.
We can get an addition 292 years by using unsigned integers,  but
it may be wiser to switch to 128-bit integers.

   Note that the usual limitations apply:  no leap seconds,  and if
the computer's time is adjusted by NTP or the user,  the result may
actually go backward.  If you want to know what time it is,  don't
ask a computer.  */
